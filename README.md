Brexit in Transnational Social Media
==============================

This repo is my work for the *Brexit in Transnational Social Media* theme in the [Helsinki Digital Humanities Hackathon #DHH19](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/helsinki-centre-for-digital-humanities/helsinki-digital-humanities-hackathon). 

It is currently in early development. 

## Getting Started

Two `make` commands allow you to recreate the environment used in this analysis. Use

- `make create_environment` for the initial creation of the environment
- `make requirements` to get the required packages.

You can test whether your environment is set up correctly with `make test_environment`.

To see which other `make` rules are available as well a description of what they do, simply use `make help`.
